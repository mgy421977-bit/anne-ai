## 1. Subject

Whether MatrAIx (population-scale persona / simulated-user evaluation infrastructure) should influence ANNE in any of the following ways:

1. Core architecture (new module or pipeline stage)
2. Redefinition of **HEAR / DUY** (e.g. as a formal “Context Acquisition Layer”)
3. Near-term roadmap priority (before Phase A evidence is complete)
4. Public claims and README positioning
5. Use as an **external** evaluation substrate only

This log records the **decision**, the **options considered**, the **evidence**, and what must **not** be claimed.

---

## 2. Context that triggered the decision

While examining HEAR (DUY) beyond “raw input reception,” a research thread proposed that reliability may depend not only on the text of an input but on **how persona, user goal, and situational context are represented at intake**.

MatrAIx appeared in the same window as a large-scale system for synthetic personas (reported **8.3B** persona records, **1,290** categorical attributes, public ~**1M** coreset). The risk was conceptual collapse:

- Treating MatrAIx’s **persona simulation** problem as the same as ANNE’s **semantic validation / ethical orchestration** problem
- Promoting HEAR to a full context-acquisition product claim without experiments
- Integrating or depending on MatrAIx before ANNE’s own Phase A (ANLA ON vs OFF) evidence exists

ANNE’s standing policy (independent engineering review response, roadmap, system card) forbids scope inflation and overclaim. This decision extends that policy to an external technology assessment.

---

## 3. Options considered

| Option | Description | Outcome |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **A — Full integration** | Depend on MatrAIx persona APIs/data inside ANNE core; persona engine as first-class module | **Rejected** |
| **B — HEAR redesign now** | Rename/redefine HEAR as formal Context Acquisition Layer; change pipeline contracts in v0.1 | **Rejected** |
| **C — External substrate only** | Document MatrAIx-class systems as optional *evaluation environment* ideas; ANNE stays SUT; no dependency | **Accepted** |
| **D — Ignore entirely** | No research note; no decision log | **Rejected** (loses transparency and invites later confusion) |
| **E — Immediate persona experiments** | Start persona-conditioned benchmarks before Phase A ANLA numbers | **Rejected** (ordering violation) |

**Accepted path = C**, with explicit ordering: Phase A first; any persona-conditioned protocol later and optional.

---

## 4. Decision (normative)

1. **Do not** integrate MatrAIx (or equivalent 8.3B / 1M persona stacks) into the ANNE core library, pipeline, or runtime dependencies.
2. **Do not** redefine HEAR/DUY in code, README, or system card as a completed “Context Acquisition Layer.”
3. **Do** treat MatrAIx-class systems as a possible **external evaluation substrate**: they may supply controlled persona/context *conditions* under which ANNE is tested as the system under test (SUT).
4. **Do** maintain strict **Implemented / Hypothesis / Future Research** labeling in all related writing.
5. **Do not** prioritize persona-conditioned experiments until Phase A (ANLA ON/OFF measurable results under `benchmarks/results/`) is in place.
6. **Do not** use MatrAIx marketing metrics (e.g. 8.3B, 91.5% persona adherence) as evidence that ANNE works.

---

## 5. Evidence summary (why C, not A/B)

### 5.1 What MatrAIx is (from primary sources)

- Simulated-user **evaluation infrastructure** for AI systems and digital products
- Persona records under a large categorical schema; agents = persona + LLM
- Environments: Survey, Chatbot, Web, App
- Validation highlights include a 400-trial behavior probe with **91.5%** assigned-behavior expression/suppression under an **LLM judge** (not human gold labels on that top-line figure)

### 5.2 Problem-class mismatch

| Dimension | MatrAIx | ANNE |
|-----------|---------|------|
| Primary object | Simulated **user** | Model **output** orchestration |
| Core question | Does the agent behave like the assigned persona? Does the product work across cohorts? | Does semantic validation + ethics + SFT improve reliability before delivery? |
| Typical metrics | Persona adherence, cohort UX, task completion under simulation | False accept/reject, SFT rate, semantic score, decision consistency |

Integrating MatrAIx into ANNE core would import a **user-simulation stack** into a **verifier/orchestrator** project without solving ANNE’s stated hypothesis.

### 5.3 Partial scientific link (why not D)

A weaker, valid link remains:

> Reliability under heterogeneous *user constraints* might differ from reliability on generic prompts. Controlled persona/context conditions can stress-test ANLA and ethical vetoes.

That justifies an **open question** and a **future optional protocol**, not architecture change.

### 5.4 HEAR specifically

- **Implemented today:** raw intake + coarse `input_type`.
- **Hypothesis:** optional structured context at intake may affect downstream stages.
- Elevating HEAR to a formal Context Acquisition Layer *now* would:
  - Conflate research hypothesis with shipped design
  - Invite external readers to assume persona/context machinery exists
  - Violate the same overclaim discipline applied after the independent engineering review

### 5.5 Ordering (roadmap discipline)

Roadmap Phase A requires ANLA evidence on the existing micro-fixture **without** persona machinery. Adding persona factors before that confounds:

- semantic-gate effects
- with persona-prompt effects
- with judge/model effects

---

## 6. Risks of the rejected options

### Option A (integration)

- Dependency and licensing/ops burden unrelated to ANLA
- Metric confusion (persona adherence reported as if it were ANNE quality)
- Scope explosion vs “cognitive architecture + ethical core” identity

### Option B (HEAR redesign now)

- Public and scientific overclaim
- API/doc drift without experimental support
- Harder falsification: failures blamed on “context layer” without baseline

### Option E (persona experiments first)

- Confounded ablations
- Delayed delivery of the one comparison the project already promised (ANLA ON vs OFF)

---

## 7. Risks of the accepted option (C) and mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Community assumes ANNE “uses MatrAIx” | Explicit non-claims in this log + open question |
| Hypothesis silently becomes roadmap commitment | Label **Future Research / not scheduled** |
| Later implementers skip Phase A | Decision item 5 is binding for prioritization |
| LLM-judge bias in any future persona suite | Prefer fixed labels; document judge limitations |

---

## 8. Status labels (binding for communication)

| Item | Label |
|------|--------|
| Six-stage pipeline, ANLA heuristic, SFT, EthicCore, FractalMemory | **Implemented** (v0.1 research preview) |
| Structured context packet at intake improves ANLA on persona-conditioned tasks | **Hypothesis** |
| MatrAIx 1M / 8.3B as ANNE evaluation harness | **Future Research** (not scheduled; not a dependency) |
| HEAR = formal Context Acquisition Layer | **Not adopted** |
| MatrAIx validates ANNE / ANNE embeds 8.3B personas | **Forbidden claim** |

---

## 9. What must not be claimed (public or internal hype)

- “ANNE integrates MatrAIx”
- “ANNE tested on 8.3 billion humans / agents”
- “HEAR is a context acquisition layer” (as implemented fact)
- “91.5% persona consistency shows ANNE works”
- “MatrAIx proves semantic validation”
- Any implication that synthetic users replace the need for real evaluation or for Phase A numbers

---

## 10. Follow-ups

| Item | Owner focus | State |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Full assessment write-up | `research/open_questions/matraix_and_hear.md` | Done |
| This decision log (detailed) | `research/decision_logs/2026-08-12_matraix_assessment.md` | Done |
| Phase A ablation results committed under `benchmarks/results/` | Engineering / research | Open |
| Optional later: 10–20 persona × small context-sensitive task **protocol draft** (design only) | Research | Blocked on Phase A |
| Code changes to HEAR / new persona module | — | **Out of scope** for this decision |

---

## 11. Alignment with prior governance

Consistent with:

- Independent engineering review response (scope reduction; no overclaim)
- `ROADMAP.md` Phase A → evidence before expansion
- System card non-claims section
- Research charter emphasis on testable hypotheses over product narrative

---

## 12. Verdict

**MatrAIx is PARTIALLY relevant to ANNE strictly as an idea for an external, controlled evaluation environment.**

It is **not** a core feature, **not** a HEAR redesign mandate, and **not** evidence for ANNE’s semantic validation hypothesis.

**One-line record:** *External eval substrate candidate only; no architecture change; Phase A first.*
