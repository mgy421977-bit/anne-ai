# Decision Log — 2026-08-14

## Subject

Adopt three **Core Rules** (Respect, Protect, Precaution) as written design intent under `governance/CORE_RULES.md`.

## Decision

1. **Accept** R1/R2/R3 as project ethical orientation and governance text.
2. **Reject** packaging them as an “unhackable / TPM-locked / absolute consciousness core.”
3. **Reject** implementing R3 as `risk > 0 ⇒ abort` while risk estimation returns a constant zero.
4. **Map** rules to existing EthicCore, ANLA, FailFast, and SFT mechanisms; document gaps honestly.
5. **Require** decision-log process for future edits to Core Rules.

## Rationale

The rules are valuable as a stable north star. Overclaiming enforcement or consciousness would violate the research charter and the independent-review response (scope and honesty).

## Status

| Item | Label |
|------|--------|
| CORE_RULES.md | **Implemented** (documentation) |
| Full formal risk engine for R3 | **Future Research** |
| Hardware / crypto immutability | **Out of scope** (v0.1) |

## Verdict

Document the rules tightly; keep the code claims tighter.
