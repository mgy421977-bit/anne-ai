## Core finding

The project correctly identifies the missing real-time semantic validation loop in token-level LLMs. The current Python/SQLite prototype does **not** implement the bio-digital AGI kernel described in vision documents. Mathematical formulations are incomplete; several category errors exist (thermodynamics / Landauer applied to semantic hallucination; GROMACS molecular dynamics linked to neural weights without a transduction interface).

## What the review judged original

- **ANLA gate + failure-trace carrying runtime loop** — potentially unique structural design: on failure, the system does not silently regenerate; it returns to DUY with a preserved structured failure meta-tag.

## What the review rejected or flagged

1. Landauer / physical entropy as treatment for semantic hallucination → **category error**
2. GROMACS / molecular simulation as driver of cognitive weights → **no computational interface**
3. Claims of “mathematically proven” / zero hallucination without formal proofs or ablation data
4. “Runtime learning” terminology for SQLite episodic retrieval (closer to RAG than weight update)
5. Missing unit tests, CI depth, standard benchmarks, ANLA ON vs OFF ablation

## Priority actions (from review) — mapped to repo work

1. Remove Landauer / physical-entropy arguments from architecture claims
2. Define a concrete semantic scoring function for ANLA (see `docs/mathematics/anla_semantic_score.md`)
3. Park molecular / BCI claims to long-horizon roadmap
4. Raise engineering bar: tests, CI, dependency clarity
5. Produce ANLA-on vs ANLA-off numerical comparison (see `benchmarks/`)
